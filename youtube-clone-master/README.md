## Youtube Clone

[Live Demo](https://youtube-clone2021.netlify.app/)

This is my first project using ReactJS. I didn't use the state management library or the useContext hook to manage the state. I'm done with prop drilling because I was really new to ReactJS. Please follow the guide below to install the app.

# Get started

Start by cloning this [repository](https://github.com/mithatercann/youtube-clone).

```
git clone https://github.com/mithatercann/youtube-clone.git
```
## Installation

You should go to Google Console and get a YouTube API key. And then create a.env file in the folder and set the variable for API_KEY.

```
cd youtube-clone

touch .env
```

```
API_KEY = Place your API key here.
```

Then go to the folder, install the requirements, and start the application with npm.

```
cd youtube-clone

npm install

npm start
```

### Completed! ðŸ¥³

The app is ready to go. Check the localhost.
